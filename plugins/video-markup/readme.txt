Simple tool for adding structured data markup for video

== Description ==
Adds a video object to the structured data for indexing services

Add the shortcode [featuredvideo] to your post after you've provided the relevant
markup information. You can specify the width and height of the video embed by
adding 'height' and 'width' attributes, ie [featuredvideo height="600" width="480"]

The format for the 'duration' field must ues the ISO 8601 format of TXXMYYS where
XX is the minutes and YY is the seconds, ie T03M25S for a video that is 3 minutes
and 25 seconds long

== Installation ==
This simply adds the markup to the header tag for a video object that you link to
Future versions of this will hopefully also embed the object
